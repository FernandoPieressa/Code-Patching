# Provided Data

Here, we provide data for the training of 3 (4 including different beam size with the base model) models.

To use this data, simply download the `train.tgz` and `test.tgz` files from the model you want to train, 
and replaice the `train.tgz` and `test.tgz` files with these. Then run the data generation and training
as described in the root README.md. In this way, you will download the files for the model you want, generate data
for that model, and train on the generated data.
